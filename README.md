# The Great Plants
You want know about why you should have plants ? I've designed a single webpage to say why.  


## What have i used ?
My javascript framework is *ReactJS*  
My javascript animation is *GSAP*  
My CSS preprocessor is *SCSS* or *SASS*  
My server side rendering is *express*  
My images came from *Google*  

And the magic of creativity came from me with my depression :)

## How to use ?
It's free and no license needed for it. Just know react and it's scripts in *package.json* is enough.

```
yarn run start
```

## What can we do ?
Nothing to do !

## Can we *fork* or *star* or *like* it ?
Yes, why you can't ? It makes me happy and the only support you can give.
